# Automatically Generating a Robust Topology for the Lightning Network on top of Bitcoin

This paper is obviously a draft risen from the discussion at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/677 and therefor open to suggestions. I'll be happy for suggestions in my issue tracker at: https://github.com/renepickhardt/Automatically-Generating-a-Robust-Topology-for-the-Lightning-Network-on-top-of-Bitcoin/issues. I will also be happy to merge substantial pull requests and add you to the list of authors. Typos will also be merged but only be put to the list of thank you notes.

For ideas and suggestions please refer to the issue tracker at https://github.com/renepickhardt/Automatically-Generating-a-Robust-Topology-for-the-Lightning-Network-on-top-of-Bitcoin/issues
